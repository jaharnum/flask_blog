## The Beginning: Building a Personal Page with Jekyll and Github Pages

I guess I should probably start out by stating it plainly: I have no idea what I am doing.

But that's half the fun of learning to code, right? Figuring it out as we go along.

### About me

I'm currently a student at Algonquin College in my third term of their Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science program. Bit of a mouthful of a program name and it's definitely trying to cram a lot into three short years.

No program can cover *everything*, though, and many of my instructors remind us of the importance of researching our own personal projects in order to hone our skills in areas that we're most interested in.

### Interest Areas

Ever since doing the basic course in databases in my first term, I've wanted to expand my skills in that area. I've even managed to secure a co-op doing data analysis next term, which is incredibly exciting!

I'm really invested in politics and social justice movements, so one of my major goals in learning computer science and data science skills is to put them to use in those arenas.

I'm really intrigued by web development, especially because what I learned in my web programming course seems majorly disconnected to what's actually available online right now. Just comparing the projects we worked on to something like Jekyll is a world of difference.

### Intention Setting

My goals with this website is to have a space to explore the personal projects I am working on, including maintaining this blog in and of itself.

Right now I'm starting from the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) system with a gorgeous theme called [Moon by Taylantatli](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/).

Here's all the new skills, applications, and frameworks that I've been looking into just to get this far:

* Ruby & Ruby gems
* Sass
* Atom (for writing posts)

This is also the first major fork I've done of another project! Since I've sort of spliced together the current version of Jekyll with the older Moon theme, they are no longer listed as forks on my repo (this might be an ettiquette faux pas and I apologize if so!).

I've never tried to manage such a large project before or even started off with so much source material. It's very exciting, to be honest, and I'm slowly making my way through the files provided to understand how all the pieces slot together.

My first plan is to get into Sass so I can modify the Moon theme and really make it my own. I'm already pretty comfy with CSS but all these fancy mixins are still a bit beyond me. :)

I also would like to start creating some basic data visualizations using API queries and posting that process here as well!

#### Thanks for reading!

I'm sure there's plenty more procedural rambling to come in the future, but this is probably more than enough to get started with!
